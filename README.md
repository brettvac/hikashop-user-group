# Hikashop Group Plugin

This plugin enables you to change the group of a user after purchasing a product in Hikashop Starter. 

Works with Joomla! 4 and is backward compatible with Joomla! 5. I believe this plugin ships with the Business edition.

I simply asked ChatGPT to update the parts that weren't working in Joomla! 4.
